        <h1>Connecting a camcorder to your computer</h1>
      </div>
      <p>To import video from your camcorder, you must connect the camcorder to your computer using a FireWire cable. Both your computer and your camcorder must have built-in FireWire ports. You need a 6-pin to 4-pin FireWire cable.</p>
      <p>Note: Some camcorder manufacturers refer to FireWire as iLink or IEEE 1394.</p>

        <h2>To connect a camcorder to your computer:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Turn off your camcorder and plug the 4-pin connector into the 4-pin port on your camcorder or on your camcorder's docking system. </li>
          <p>Note: The 4-pin connector is extremely fragile. Make sure the notches are properly aligned and do not force it into the port. </p>
          <li>Plug the 6-pin connector into the FireWire port on your computer.</li>
          <li>Turn on your camcorder and set it to VTR mode (some camcorders call this Play or VCR).</li>
          <li>Open iMovie HD.</li>
          <p>You can now import video from your camcorder using the controls in iMovie HD. See Related Topics below.</p>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p>If you can't turn on your camcorder, switch it to VTR mode. If you have a power supply instead of a battery, set the power adapter switch to VTR/Camera mode.</p>
      <p>FireWire, also known as IEEE 1394, is a standard protocol for transmitting information over a single cable. FireWire allows the rapid transmission of audio and video data between your camcorder and your computer and enables you to control your camcorder's playback functions from iMovie HD.</p>
      <p>Some camcorders may not have a FireWire port. For example, some cameras that produce MPEG-4 video use USB ports as video connections. Although you cannot import the video directly into iMovie HD, you can use the USB port to transfer your footage onto your hard disk, and then drag and drop your video clips into your iMovie HD projects.</p>
