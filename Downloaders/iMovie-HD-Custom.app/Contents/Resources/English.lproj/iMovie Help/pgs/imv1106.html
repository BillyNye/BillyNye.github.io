        <h1>Adding motion to a photo</h1>
      </div>
      <p>You can add visual interest to a still photograph by panning across the image or by zooming in or out. You can achieve interesting results using pan and zoom together. For example, if you have a photograph of a championship soccer team, you could set up the photograph to slowly zoom in and pan across the group to focus on the trophy in the final frame.</p>
      <p>You can add motion to a photo before adding it to your movie, or any time after you've added it.</p>

        <h2>To add motion to a photo:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Click the Media button, and then click Photos at the top of the Media pane.</li>
          <li>Do one of the following to select the photo:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>If you're adding the photo to your movie, select a photo from your iPhoto library in the Photos pane.</li>
            <li>If you've already added the photo to your movie, select it in the clip viewer or timeline viewer.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>If you don't see the Photo Settings window, click Show Photo Settings.</li>
          <li>In the Photo Settings window, select the Ken Burns Effect checkbox.</li>
          <li>Click Start.</li>
          <li>Use the zoom control (shown above) to move to the starting point for a zoom.</li>
          <li>Hold the pointer over the image in the iMovie monitor, then press the mouse button and drag to the spot in the photograph where you want to begin the pan.</li>
          <li>Click End.</li>
          <li>Use the zoom slider to move to the ending point for the zoom.</li>
          <li>Hold the pointer over the image in the iMovie monitor, then press the mouse button and drag to the point at which you want to end the pan.</li>
          <li>Move the duration slider to set the length of time you want the pan and zoom action to take.</li>
          <li>Use the preview controls to preview the overall effect.</li>
          <p>To reverse the motion of the effect, click Reverse.</p>
          <li>Do one of the following:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>To apply your changes to a photo you've selected in the movie, click Apply.</li>
            <li>To add the photo to your movie, drag it from the Media pane to the clip viewer or timeline viewer. You can also click Apply if you want the photo added to the end of your movie.</li>
          </ul>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p>Tip: If you want to apply the same settings to more than one photograph (or all the photographs in your movie), select them before you do the steps above. When you click Apply, all the selected photographs are rendered at the same time. To learn how to select multiple photos, see "Selecting clips" below.</p>
      <p>You can also crop an image without adding motion to it. For more information, see Related Topics below.</p>
