        <h1>Adding a web link to your movie</h1>
      </div>
      <p>If you intend to publish your movie to the Internet as a video podcast or share it as a QuickTime movie, you can add web links to it. When your movie is played, the web link appears and viewers can click the link to open the webpage in a separate browser window.</p>
      <p>You add a web link to your movie as part of a chapter marker. The web link appears over that section of your movie.</p>
      <div id="taskbox">
        <h2>To add a web link to your movie:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Move the playhead to the point at which you want to display the web link.</li>
          <p>Note: The web link will be displayed in your movie for 8 seconds; therefore, it's a good idea not to add a web link any later than 8 seconds before the end of the movie. It's also a good idea not to add a web link within a transition. If you do so, it may be difficult to see. Because a web link appears as dark blue text in a QuickTime movie, add it to a piece of video with contrasting color so the link is easy to see.</p>
          <li>Click the Chapters button, and then click Add Marker.</li>
          <p>Tip: To quickly add a chapter marker, you can also choose Markers &gt; Add Chapter Marker.</p>
          <li>Type a chapter title next to the thumbnail that appears in the Chapters pane.</li>
          <li>Double-click Link URL below the chapter title and type the web address. (If you don't see Link URL below the chapter title, choose Markers &gt; Show Podcast URLs.)</li>
          <p>IMPORTANT: Be sure to include the full URL, including "http://" or other required parts of the address. If you don't include the full address, your recipient may not be able to click the link to go to the website.</p>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p>Chapter markers appear in the timeline viewer as yellow diamonds.</p>
      <p>Note: You won't be able to see the web link when previewing your movie in iMovie HD. Web links appear only after you export your movie as a podcast or QuickTime movie.</p>
      <p>To remove a chapter marker and its web link, select the chapter marker in the timeline viewer, and then choose Markers &gt; Delete Chapter Marker. (You can also select the chapter marker in the Chapters pane, and then click Remove Marker.) If you only delete the URL in the Chapters pane, the marker behaves as an ordinary chapter marker.</p>
      <p>IMPORTANT: Web links you add to your movie do not appear in iDVD. When sharing your movie to iDVD, the places you added web links are treated as ordinary chapter markers. If you don't want a web link to appear as a chapter marker in iDVD, you can delete the chapter marker in iMovie before exporting your project to iDVD, or you can delete the chapter menu item using iDVD.</p>
