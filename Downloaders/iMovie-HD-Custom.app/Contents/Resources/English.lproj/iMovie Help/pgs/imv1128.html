        <h1>My camcorder won't communicate with iMovie HD</h1>
      </div>
      <p>If you've checked to make sure your camcorder is securely connected to your computer's FireWire ports (not USB), and your camcorder is turned on and set to VTR mode (some cameras call this Play or VCR), here are a few more things you can try:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Check your camcorder's documentation to determine how to view and set the video recording quality. The quality levels are usually called "SP," "LP," "E-SP," and "E-LP." When you use your camcorder with iMovie HD, make sure the recording quality is set to SP, even if you recorded the video at a different quality level. SP and LP modes work well when you record video that you plan to import into iMovie HD. Before you record using other modes, you should try importing a sample recording first, to make sure it is compatible.</li>
        <li>Check the date and time on your camcorder. Odd as this may seem, an incorrect date and time is one of the most frequent reasons that camcorders can't communicate with iMovie HD. If you've never set the date and time for your camcorder, follow the instructions in your owner's manual to set it. Then turn your camcorder's power off and then on again (this is called "cycling the power"). Connect your camcorder to your computer and try importing into iMovie HD again. If the problem persists, follow the steps below.</li>
      </ul>
      <div id="taskbox">
        <h2>To fully reset your camcorder:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Disconnect all the cables from the camcorder, including any power cables.</li>
          <li>Remove the main battery pack.</li>
          <li>Remove the backup battery, which is usually a coin-sized battery below or behind the main battery.</li>
          <li>Wait 1 minute.</li>
          <li>Replace the backup battery, then the main battery, then any power cables.</li>
          <li>Turn on the camcorder and set it to "camera mode." The camcorder's display should tell you that the date and time need to be set. If not, check the camcorder's date and time to see if they are wrong. If they are right, repeat steps 1-5 but wait several minutes before replacing the batteries.</li>
          <li>Set the correct date and time.</li>
          <li>Set the camcorder to VTR (playback) mode. (Some camcorders call this Play or VCR.)</li>
          <li>Reconnect the FireWire cable between your computer and your camcorder.</li>
        </ol>
