        <h1>Adding titles or text</h1>
      </div>
      <p>With iMovie HD, you can add a variety of text to your movie, including film titles, credits, subtitles, and much more. You can also select a font and color for your text and chose how you want it to move on and off screen.</p>
      <p>Tip: When creating a title, be sure its duration isn't longer than the duration of the video clip or color clip that it appears over. You can place a short title sequence on a longer clip, but you can't place a long title sequence on a short clip.</p>
      <p>IMPORTANT: To add titles to a clip that contains a transition, remove the transition first, and then add your text and reapply the transition.</p>
      <div id="taskbox">
        <h2>To create a title for a clip:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Click the Editing button, and then click Titles at the top of the Editing pane.</li>
          <li>Select a title style from the titles list.</li>
          <p>You see a preview of the title in the iMovie monitor.</p>
          <li>If necessary, set a direction for the title using the arrow buttons.</li>
          <li>Type the text you want in the text fields. </li>
          <p>Some title styles include Add (+) or Delete (-) buttons so you can add or delete lines of text.</p>
          <li>To change the color of the text, click the Color box to select a color.</li>
          <li>Choose a font style from the Family and TypeFace pop-up menus, and drag the size slider to change text size.</li>
          <li>Drag the speed slider and pause slider to change the duration of the title.</li>
          <p>The title's total duration is the sum of the speed and the pause durations, shown at the bottom of the Titles pane.</p>
          <li>If you want the title to appear over a black background, select the "Over black" checkbox.</li>
          <li>You can set the origination point of some title styles. If you see a position indicator in the iMovie monitor, drag it to a location in the monitor where you want the title to begin.</li>
          <li>To add the title to your movie, do one of the following:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>To have your title appear over black, make sure you selected the "Over black" checkbox in step 8 above, and drag the title from the titles list to where you want it to appear in the clip viewer or timeline viewer.</li>
            <li>To have the title start over the beginning of a clip, make sure you did not select the "Over black" checkbox in step 8 above, and drag the title from the titles list to the left of the clip you want to play underneath the title.</li>
            <li>To have the title start in the middle of a clip, move the playhead to where you want the title to start, and then click the Add button at the bottom of the Titles pane. (Because iMovie titles can only start at the beginning of a clip, iMovie creates a new clip at the spot where you want your title to begin by splitting the existing clip in two.)</li>
          </ul>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p>If the title you created is shorter than the video clip you added it to, iMovie splits the clip in two, and the first of the two resulting clips contains the title. If the title is longer than the clip, the title automatically extends across the next clip or clips in your movie. If this is the case, the final clip on which the title appears will be split where the title ends.</p>
      <p>After you add a title to your movie, you can change or remove it at any time. For more information, see Related Topics below.</p>
