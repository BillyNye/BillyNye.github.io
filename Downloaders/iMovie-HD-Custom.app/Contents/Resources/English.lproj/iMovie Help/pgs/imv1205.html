        <h1>Using theme elements in your movie</h1>
      </div>
      <p>You can choose from a collection of titles and visual effects to combine your video and photos with stunning backgrounds and animated graphics called "themes." Use themes to add Hollywood-style polish to your movie and give it a creative and unified design.</p>
      <p>IMPORTANT: To use themes in your movie, you must be using Mac OS X version 10.4.4 or later.</p>
      <div id="taskbox">
        <h2>To use a theme element in your movie:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Click the Themes button.</li>
          <li>Choose a theme from the pop-up menu at the top of the Themes pane.</li>
          <li>Select a theme element that you want to use in your movie from the Theme Elements area.</li>
          <p>The Drop Zones window opens, and the theme previews in the iMovie monitor.</p>
          <li>If the theme you chose contains titles, type your title in the Title field. (Some themes have multiple title fields.)</li>
          <li>Do one or both of the following:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>To add video clips to the theme, click the Clips button and drag video clips to the drop zones in the Drop Zones window.</li>
            <li>To add photos to the theme, click the Media button, click Photos at the top of the media pane, and then drag photos to the drop zones in the Drop Zones window.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To remove an item from a drop zone, click the drop zone to select it, and then press the Delete key or drag it out of the drop zone.</p>
          <li>Click the Themes button to return to the Themes pane.</li>
          <li>Click Apply.</li>
          <p>The new clip is added to the end of your movie. A red progress bar indicates that the theme is rendering.</p>
          <li>After the clip has finished rendering, drag it to where you want it to appear in your movie.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p>
        <img src="../gfx/imv1078a.jpg" alt="Image of Timeline Viewer button and playhead"></p>
      <p>Tip: After you've created a theme, you can also add it to your movie by dragging it directly from the Themes pane.</p>
      <p>After you've added a theme element to your movie, you can change its duration by dragging one of its edges in the timeline viewer. You can also apply transitions and effects to it, as you would with any video clip. To remove a theme from your movie, select its clip in the clip viewer or timeline viewer, and then press the Delete key.</p>
