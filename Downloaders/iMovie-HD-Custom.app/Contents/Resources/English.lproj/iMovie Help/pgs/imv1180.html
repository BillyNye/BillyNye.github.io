        <h1>About building your movie</h1>
      </div>
      <p>After you import video into your iMovie HD project, you're ready to start building your movie. Follow these basic steps for choosing the footage you want to show, adding it to your movie, and arranging it how you want.</p>
      <p>For detailed instructions on completing each task, see Related Topics below.</p>
      <p>
        <img src="../gfx/imv1180a.jpg" alt="Image of Clips pane"></p>
      <div id="taskbox">
        <h2>To build your movie:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Review each clip and give it an appropriate name in the Clips pane (shown above).</li>
          <p>When you imported your clips, iMovie automatically named them for you (Clip 01, Clip 02, Clip 03, and so on.) However, it's a good idea to review each clip and give it a name that makes it easier to identify.</p>
          <p>To learn how to play and rename each clip, see "Playing a clip" and "Renaming clips" below.</p>
          <li>Crop your clips so that they contain only the footage you want to show.</li>
          <p>Cropping allows you to edit a clip by keeping only the portion of video you like and removing the rest. To learn how, see "Cropping video clips" below.</p>
          <li>Drag the clips you want to include in your movie from the Clips pane to the clip viewer (shown below).</li>
          <p>This is where your movie starts to take shape. If you need help with this, see "Adding clips to your movie."</p>
          <li>Play your movie to review your progress.</li>
          <p>Now that you've added clips to your movie, you can see how they look as a series of scenes played from left to right in the clip viewer. See "Playing your movie" to learn how.</p>
          <li>If you want, change the order of scenes by dragging them left or right in the clip viewer.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p>
        <img src="../gfx/imv1180b.jpg" alt="Image of clips viewer"></p>
      <p>Congratulations! You have built the "rough cut" (or first draft) of your movie. You are now ready to move on to fine-tuning where your scenes begin and end, adding dissolves and other transitions between scenes, and bringing your movie to life with music, visual effects, titles, and more.</p>
