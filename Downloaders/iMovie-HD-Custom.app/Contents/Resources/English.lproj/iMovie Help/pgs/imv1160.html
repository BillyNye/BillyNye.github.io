        <h1>Creating a movie automatically with Magic iMovie</h1>
      </div>
      <p>If you have a simple video or home movie, you can use the "Magic iMovie" feature to have iMovie HD import your video and compose a movie for you. You can specify the title of the movie and the kind of transitions you want between scenes, and have iMovie HD add music. With the click of a button, iMovie HD imports and creates your entire movie. You can even automatically send the completed movie to iDVD, where you can design and create Hollywood-style DVD discs. </p>
      <p>After iMovie HD creates a movie for you, you can always edit and make changes later to fine-tune and polish your movie.</p>
      <p>Important: To make a movie using the Magic iMovie feature, you must connect your camcorder to your computer using a FireWire cable. You cannot use a USB connection to import the video for a Magic iMovie.</p>
      <div id="taskbox">
        <h2>To create a movie automatically:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Connect your camera to your computer using a FireWire cable.</li>
          <li>Turn on your camera, and set the camera to VTR mode (some cameras call this Play or VCR).</li>
          <li>Open iMovie HD and click the "Make a Magic iMovie" button or choose File &gt; "Make a Magic iMovie."</li>
          <li>Enter a title for your movie in the "Movie title" field.</li>
          <li>Select whether you want iMovie HD to rewind the tape in your camera before capturing footage.</li>
          <li>If you want iMovie HD to stop capturing footage at a specific point in your video, select the "Stop capturing" checkbox and specify the number of minutes you want captured.</li>
          <li>To add transitions between scenes, select the "Use transitions" checkbox and choose the transition you want from the pop-up menu. </li>
          <p>Once the movie has been created, you can change the transitions later. If you'd like iMovie HD to randomly use different transitions in your movie, choose Random from the pop-up menu.</p>
          <li>To add a music soundtrack, select the "Play music soundtrack" checkbox, if needed. Click the Choose Music button and add the music selections you want to the playlist. Use the volume slider to set how loud you want the music soundtrack to play in your movie. Then click OK.</li>
          <p>iMovie HD will add the selected music to the movie. If you have one song and the video is shorter than the song, the song ends when the video does. If you have several songs in your playlist, the songs play in order and the playlist repeats until the video ends. You can rearrange the songs in your playlist by dragging.</p>
          <li>To have your movie become an iDVD project, click the "Send to iDVD" checkbox. Once the movie has been completed, iDVD opens and imports your movie. You can work with your movie to design and burn a great-looking, Hollywood-style DVD.</li>
          <li>Click Create.</li>
        </ol>
