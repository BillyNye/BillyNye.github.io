        <h1>Adding a dissolve or other transition between clips</h1>
      </div>
      <p>You can add transitions between clips to smooth or blend the change from one scene to another. You can have clips fade in or out, dissolve into another clip, push one scene aside as the new scene enters, and so on.</p>
      <p>Tip: When you add a transition to your movie, it may blur or hide some footage that you want viewers to see. Therefore, it's a good idea to add extra time to the end or beginning of clips that you plan to add transitions to. (The amount of footage in a clip that's used up by a transition equals about half the length of the transition.) To adjust the length of your clips, see "Fine-tuning where a clip begins and ends."</p>
      <div id="taskbox">
        <h2>To add a transition between clips:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Drag the playhead near the location where you plan to add the transition. </li>
          <li>Click the Editing button, and then click Transitions at the top of the Editing pane.</li>
          <li>Click a transition style in the transitions list to select it.</li>
          <p>You see a preview of the transition in the iMovie monitor.</p>
          <li>Set the duration of the transition using the Speed slider. </li>
          <li>If necessary, set a direction for the transition using the arrow buttons.</li>
          <li>To add the transition to your movie, drag it from the transitions list to the clip viewer or timeline viewer.</li>
        </ol>
      </div>
      <p>
        <img src="../gfx/imv1028.jpg" alt="Image of clip being added to the timeline viewer"></p>
      <p>When you drag the transition between the two clips you want joined, iMovie automatically makes room for it. (Fade and Wash effects are the only transitions that can be added to the beginning or end of a movie.) A red progress bar indicates when the transition has finished rendering.</p>
      <p>To see how a transition looks in the clip or timeline viewer, move the playhead to a point in the movie before the transition (with no clip selected) and click the Play button.</p>
      <p>After you've added a transition to your movie, you can select the transition's clip to play it, change it, or delete it at any time. For more information, see Related Topics below.</p>
      <p>Tip: You can change multiple transitions in a movie with a single procedure. Just select the clips you want (or all the clips in the movie), set up the transition options you want, and click Update. To select all your transitions at once, select a single transition and then choose Edit &gt; Select Similar Clips.</p>
