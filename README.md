# BillyNye.github.io

  This site is an archive of sorts for internal/leaked softwares and firmwares. Think "The Iphone Wiki", but with downloads and without the wiki. I might later make this site an unofficial companion to TIW if it gains popularity, and doesn't get shut down. 

  You can contact me at Nyes.mega@gmail.com for questions. 
  
  
  If you have an issue with the presence of any of the fws/sws hosted here *please* contact me before reporting/striking my GH account, I will not hesitate to take down a file if there is a legitimate reason to do so. Thanks in advance!
